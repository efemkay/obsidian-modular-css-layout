# Installation

This is actually just a CSS code snippets collection. So it isn't an installation per se, but rather **download and enable** in Obsidian.

### Using Snippet Downloader (recommended)
Snippet Downloader is an Obsidian community plugin by Mara Li. Since I'm planning to update this snippets from time to time, this is the recommended approach as the plugin also provides a way to update/redownload from included repository

> Please ensure your vault's /.obsidian/snippets folder is already created before doing the following steps. You can do that by going to `Settings > Appearance` and click "Open snippets folder" under CSS snippets section

- In Obsidian, go to `Settings > Community Plugins > Browse` and search for Snippet Downloader by Mara-Li
- Install and enable the plugin
- Open Command Pallete (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`), select Snippet Downloader: Add new snippet
- In the Repo Link area paste the following link `https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout`

### Manually Saving from GH

- Open your browser and go to MCL's GH [landing page](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout)
- Click on the snippet you want to save, (on the blob page) click on "Raw" at the top left, and (on the raw page) copy the entire text
> *GH raw page will open up the css file within your browser in plain-text format for easy copy pasting*
- Open any text editor in your desktop and paste the snippet
- Save the file as a `.css` file into your `[vault]/.obsidian/snippets` folder. Filename can be anything.
- Open Obisidian and go to `Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets` to enable the snippet.
> *Click on "Reload snippets" button if the snippet does not appear in the list.*
